Setup
======

* Generally it is recommended to use python version 3.8 for this repo, as not all libraries support python 3.9 yet. Most one-ai workbenches should have conda now which will allow you to easily create a new conda environment with this version.

* In order to run the pipeline and the FastAPI app you will need to configure your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the src folder in this repo. You can do this by "exporting" the invironment variable in your .bashrc, like this

| ``export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:``

Alternatively you can set it up in your VSCode settings or in your .env folder.

* Most data that we use in our datapipelines lives in S3. In order for Kedro to talk to S3, you must add the S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) to your credentials file. This file needs to be created under <repo home>/config/local/credentials.yml and it should contain the following:

| ``aws:``
    | ``key: <the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID value>``
    | ``secret: <the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY value>``

* For frontend development nodejs/npm needs to be installed. This can be done with the following commands:

| ``curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash â€“``
| ``sudo apt install nodejs``
